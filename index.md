## Welcome to Pip's GitHub Pages

Link to the public page is: [https://pipcourbois.github.io/](https://pipcourbois.github.io/)

This github includes projects I am working on during my free time. I am pationate about statistical modeling, inference, and data in general. You will find that pation within these pages.

It is nothing more than a set of markdown blog posts.  The posts link to code, data, and other resources.  Top three are here, the rest are on the [Blog page](/blog).
